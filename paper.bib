   abstract = {Prolonged QT intervals are a major risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias and a leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Various drugs are known to trigger QT interval prolongation and increase the proarrhythmic potential. Yet, how precisely the action of drugs on the cellular level translates into QT interval prolongation on the whole organ level remains insufficiently understood. Here we use machine learning techniques to systematically characterize the effect of 30 common drugs on the QT interval. We combine information from high fidelity three-dimensional human heart simulations with low fidelity one-dimensional cable simulations to build a surrogate model for the QT interval using multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression. Once trained and cross-validated, we apply our surrogate model to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that compounds that block the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current I Kr have the greatest prolonging effect of the QT interval, and that blocking the L-type calcium current I CaL and late sodium current I NaL shortens the QT interval. Our uncertainty quantification allows us to propagate the experimental variability from individual block-concentration measurements into the QT interval and reveals that QT interval uncertainty is mainly driven by the variability in I Kr block. In a final validation study, we demonstrate an excellent agreement between our predicted QT interval changes and the changes observed in a randomized clinical trial for the drugs dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and verapamil. We anticipate that both the machine learning methods and the results of this study will have great potential in the efficient development of safer drugs.},

   abstract = {The Bias Correction and Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) is a trend-preserving statistical downscaling algorithm, which has been widely used to generate accurate and high-resolution data set. We employ the BCSD technique to statistically downscale projected daily maximum temperature (DMT) over China from 13 general circulation models in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) project to supplement the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections data set under the Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6) scenario. We then compare the differences of DMT and four DMT-related indices (i.e., summer days (SU), annual maximum value of DMT (TXx), intensity, and frequency of heat wave) between before and after downscaling over eight subregions of China. The results indicate that the BCSD method reduces the cool bias of the DMT over the whole China compared with original CMIP5 simulations, especially over the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. The SU increases after downscaling for both China as a whole and most subregions except for South China. The BCSD also affects the mean value of TXx, intensity, and frequency of heat wave at subregional scales, although it shows little impact on China as a whole. Besides, the BCSD reduces the temporal variability of most indices except for the heat wave frequency. The most striking finding is that the intermodel spreads of DMT, SU, TXx, and heat wave intensity are dramatically reduced after downscaling compared with raw CMIP5 simulations. In summary, the BCSD method shows significant improvements to original CMIP5 climate projections under RCP2.6 scenario.},

Its time-varying power output is difficult to model credibly because it depends on complex and variable weather systems, leading to difficulty in understanding its potential and limitations. We demonstrate how the MERRA and MERRA-2 global meteorological reanalyses as well as the Meteosat-based CM-SAF SARAH satellite dataset can be used to produce hourly PV simulations across Europe. To validate these simulations, we gather metered time series from more than 1000 PV systems as well as national aggregate output reported by transmission network operators. We find slightly better accuracy from satellite data, but greater stability from reanalysis data. We correct for systematic bias by matching our simulations to the mean bias in modeling individual sites, then examine the long-term patterns, variability and correlation with power demand across Europe, using thirty years of simulated outputs. The results quantify how the increasing deployment of PV substantially changes net power demand and affects system adequacy and ramping requirements, with heterogeneous impacts across different European countries. The simulation code and the hourly simulations for all European countries are available freely via an interactive web platform, www.renewables.ninja.},

   abstract = {Society's dependence on weather systems has broadened to include electricity generation from wind turbines. Climate change is altering energy flows in the atmosphere, which will affect the economic potential of wind power. Changes to wind resources and their upstream impacts on the energy industry have received limited academic attention, despite their risks earning interest from investors. We propose a framework for assessing the impact of climate change on the cost of wind energy, going from the change in hourly wind speed distributions from radiative forcing through to energy output and levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from wind farms. The paper outlines the proof of concept for this framework, exploring the limitations of global climate models for assessing wind resources, and a novel Weibull transfer function to characterise the climate signal. The framework is demonstrated by considering the UK's wind resources to 2100. Results are mixed: capacity factors increase in some regions and decrease in others, while the year-to-year variation generally increases. This highlights important financial and risk impacts which can be adopted into policy to enhance energy system resilience to the impacts of climate change. We call for greater emphasis to be placed on modelling wind resources in climate science.},

EnergyPLAN is designed to exploit the synergies enabled from including the whole energy system, as expressed in the smart energy system concept. Thus, with EnergyPLAN, the user can take a holistic approach focusing on the analysis of the cross-sectoral interaction. Traditionally disparate demand sectors, such as buildings, industry and transport, are linked with supply technologies through electricity, gas, district heating and cooling grids. In this way, EnergyPLAN enables the analysis of the conversion of renewable electricity into other energy carriers, such as heat, hydrogen, green gases and electrofuels, as well as the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and energy conservation.

This review critically examines recent advances in modeling and simulation in the energy sector, with few insights on its approaches, challenges, and prospects in selected renewable and sustainable energy systems (RSES). In addition, the concept of model validation in RSES is systematically discussed based on in-sample and out-of-sample approaches, while potential data sources with crucial elements for model validation in RSES are highlighted. Furthermore, three major groups of sustainable energy system models that play important roles in supporting national and international energy policies arepresented, to bring to light how the modeling of energy systems is evolving to meet its challenges in the design, operation, and control of RSES. This review also presents a comprehensive assessment of the current approaches, challenges, and prospects in modeling the behavior and evaluating the performance of RSES. Finally, areas that need further research and development in renewable and sustainable energy system modeling are also highlighted.},

   abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) possess many positive qualities when it comes to spatial raster data. Translation invariance enables CNNs to detect features regardless of their position in the scene. However, in some domains, like geospatial, not all locations are exactly equal. In this work, we propose localized convolutional neural networks that enable convolutional architectures to learn local features in addition to the global ones. We investigate their instantiations in the form of learnable inputs, local weights, and a more general form. They can be added to any convolutional layers, easily end-to-end trained, introduce minimal additional complexity, and let CNNs retain most of their benefits to the extent that they are needed. In this work we address spatio-temporal prediction: test the effectiveness of our methods on a synthetic benchmark dataset and tackle three real-world wind prediction datasets. For one of them, we propose a method to spatially order the unordered data. We compare the recent state-of-the-art spatio-temporal prediction models on the same data. Models that use convolutional layers can be and are extended with our localizations. In all these cases our extensions improve the results, and thus often the state-of-the-art.

Moreover, this paper identifies that the main challenges of this research field rotate around the concept of resolution. A matrix of challenges in which four main fields are identified: resolution in time, in space, in techno-economic detail and in sector-coupling. These main fields are divided into different levels of resolution: low, medium and high. The use of a low resolution introduces errors in the modelling as demonstrated by different studies. Several existing bottom-up energy system models are reviewed in order to classify them according to the proposed approach and map them through the proposed matrix. 13 different models are analyzed in the category of bottom-up short-term and 9 as bottom-up long-term energy system models. The following mapping shows how several models reach a high level of resolution in one or more than one area. However, the ultimate challenge is the simultaneous achievement of high resolution in all these fields. The literature review has shown how this final aim is not reached by any model at the current stage and it highlights the gap and weaknesses of this branch of research and the direction versus which is important to work to improve this type of modelling.},

   abstract = {As wind generation increases, system impact studies rely on predictions of future generation and effective representation of wind variability. A well-established approach to investigate the impact of wind variability is to simulate generation using observations from 10 m meteorological mast-data. However, there are problems with relying purely on historical wind-speed records or generation histories: mast-data is often incomplete, not sited at a relevant wind generation sites, and recorded at the wrong altitude above ground (usually 10 m), each of which may distort the generation profile. A possible complimentary approach is to use reanalysis data, where data assimilation techniques are combined with state-of-the-art weather forecast models to produce complete gridded wind time-series over an area.Previous investigations of reanalysis datasets have placed an emphasis on comparing reanalysis to meteorological site records whereas this paper compares wind generation simulated using reanalysis data directly against historic wind generation records. Importantly, this comparison is conducted using raw reanalysis data (typical resolution ~50 km), without relying on a computationally expensive " dynamical downscaling" for a particular target region. Although the raw reanalysis data cannot, by nature of its construction, represent the site-specific effects of sub-gridscale topography, it is nevertheless shown to be comparable to or better than the mast-based simulation in the region considered and it is therefore argued that raw reanalysis data may offer a number of significant advantages as a data source. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Energy system models create coherent quantitative descriptions of how energy is con- verted, transported, and consumed, at scales ranging from urban districts to entire conti- nents. Formulating such models as optimisation problems allows a modeller to asses the effect of constraints, such as limited land availability for wind power deployment, the cost of battery electricity storage, or the elimination of fossil fuels from a country or a city, on the feasibility or cost of the modelled system. These models are particularly important in planning and policy-making for the transformation of the global energy system to address climate change. Calliope is a framework to build energy system models, designed to analyse systems with arbitrarily high spatial and temporal resolution, with a scale-agnostic mathematical formulation permitting analyses ranging from single urban districts to countries and con- tinents. Its formulation of energy system components was influenced by the power nodes modelling framework by Heussen et al. (Heussen, Koch, Ulbig, & Andersson, 2010), but generalised to consider energy carriers other than electricity. Calliope’s key features in- clude the ability to handle high spatial and temporal resolution and to easily run on high-performance computing systems. Its design cleanly separates the general framework (code) from the problem-specific model (data). It provides both a command-line interface and an API for programmatic use, to be useful both for users experienced with Python and those with no Python knowledge. A Calliope model consists of a collection of YAML and CSV files that define technologies, locations, links between locations, resource potentials, and other constraints. Calliope takes these files, constructs an optimisation problem, solves it, and reports results in the form of xarray (xarray, 2018) Datasets, which can easily be saved to NetCDF files for further processing. It uses Pyomo (Pyomo, 2018) as a backend to interface with both open and commercial solvers, currently handling linear and mixed-integer problems, although nonlinear components could be implemented if necessary for new kinds of problems. Cal- liope’s built-in tools allow interactive exploration of results using Plotly (Plotly, 2018), as shown in Figure 1. Calliope has been used in various studies, for example, analyses of the national-scale power systems in Britain (Pfenninger & Keirstead, 2015a) and South Africa (Pfenninger & Keirstead, 2015b), and in methodological development for piecewise linearisation of characteristic technology performance curves for district-scale energy system analysis (Pickering & Choudhary, 2017). Ongoing research projects using Calliope include the effect of increased resilience to uncertain future demand and the interaction between local and national actors in the clean energy transition. Calliope is developed in the open on GitHub (Pfenninger & Pickering, 2018) and each release is archived on Zenodo (Pfenninger & Pickering, n.d.).},

   abstract = {We have assessed the dependency of wind power resources in Western Europe on the atmospheric circulation as represented by a new set of 8 tailored weather regimes (WRs). For this purpose, we have derived wind capacity factors (CFs) from a meteorological reanalysis dataset and from high-resolution data simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. We first show that WRs capture effectively year-round onshore wind power production variability across Europe, especially over northwestern/central Europe and Iberia. Since the influence of the large-scale circulation on wind energy production is regionally dependent, we have then examined the high-resolution CF data interpolated to the location of more than 100 wind farms in two regions with different orography and climatological features, the United Kingdom and the Iberian Peninsula. The use of the monthly frequencies of occurrence of WRs as predictors in a multi-linear regression model allows explaining up to two thirds of the month-to-month CF variability for most seasons and sub-regions. These results outperform those previously reported based on Euro-Atlantic modes of atmospheric circulation, indicating that the use of WRs customized to the region of study is preferred to reproduce the evolution of wind energy resources. Finally, we have applied these WRs to understand the day-to-day evolution of specific episodes with anomalous regional wind power production. In particular, the wind energy deficit of summer 2018 in the United Kingdom and the surplus of March 2018 in Iberia stemmed from the combination of WRs associated with low and high CFs, respectively. These findings are relevant for the forecast of wind energy resources as the large-scale features of the atmospheric circulation captured by WRs can be modelled with considerably less uncertainty than wind speeds at wind farm sites.},

In this study, mean sea level pressure data from a new-generation reanalysis (ERA5) are utilised to classify synoptic systems into 30 different weather patterns using a self-organising map (SOM) approach. ERA5 wind speeds are then used in conjunction with a reference 8 MW wind turbine power curve to estimate wind power values at selected offshore sites.

   abstract = {High-resolution simulations are conducted with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to evaluate the sensitivity of wake effects and power production from two wind farm parameterizations [the commonly used Fitch scheme and the more recently developed Explicit Wake Parameterization (EWP)] to the resolution at which the model is applied. The simulations are conducted for a 9-month period for a domain encompassing much of the U.S. Midwest. The two horizontal resolutions considered are 4 km 3 4 km and 2 km 3 2 km grid cells, and the two vertical discretizations employ either 41 or 57 vertical layers (with the latter having double the number in the lowest 1 km). Higher wind speeds are observed close to the wind turbine hub height when a larger number of vertical layers are employed (12 in the lowest 200 m vs 6), which contributes to higher power production from both wind farm schemes. Differences in gross capacity factors for wind turbine power production from the two wind farm parameterizations and with resolution are most strongly manifest under stable conditions (i.e., at night). The spatial extent of wind farm wakes when defined as the area affected by velocity deficits near to wind turbine hub heights in excess of 2% of the simulation without wind turbines is considerably larger in simulations with the Fitch scheme. This spatial extent is generally reduced by increasing the horizontal resolution and/or increasing the number of vertical levels. These results have important applications to projections of expected annual energy production from new wind turbine arrays constructed in the wind shadow from existing wind farms.},

It estimates a set of plausible electricity capacity margins that could be delivered by the market over the next four years and the associated risks to security of supply. We assess that the risks to electricity security of supply will increase in the next four years. In particular, we expect that electricity de-rated capacity margins will decrease significantly from the current historically high levels. In parallel, the risk of electricity customer disconnections will appreciably increase from near zero levels. This is primarily because of a significant reduction in electricity supplies from coal and oil plants which are due to close under European environmental legislation. Although it is clear that risks to security of supply will increase, it is very difficult to accurately forecast the level of security of supply provided by the market. This is because of uncertainties regarding commercial decisions about generating plants, electricity interconnection flows to and from the Continent, and the level of demand. We have developed several sensitivities to capture these uncertainties.},

The simplification it relies upon is to neglect dynamic constraints such as start-up penalties, energy storage, minimum stable loads, reserve requirements and maximum ramp rates. We demonstrate a non-linear optimised dispatch algorithm and compare it to the merit order stack approach, using the GB system in 2020 as an example. We find that two constraints (start-up costs and minimum output levels) are the greatest source of error: the merit order stack underestimates the optimal level of investment in both peaking plant and inflexible baseload generators, and thus their run-times by up to 30%. A simple heuristic can be applied to the data on plant costs to account for start-ups, which reduces this error by a factor of two. This enables the benefits of the merit order stack (speed, simplicity and transparency) to hold in more dynamic and intermittent simulations.},

The MCP models used to date share the postulate that the influence of air density variation is of little importance, assume the standard value of 1.225 kg m−3 and only consider wind turbines (WTs) with blade pitch control. A performance assessment is undertaken in this paper of the models used to date and of newly proposed models. Our models incorporate air density in the MCP model as an additional covariable in long-term WTPO estimation and consider both WTs with blade pitch control and stall-regulated WTs. The advantages of including this covariable are assessed using different functional forms and different machine learning algorithms for their implementation (Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine for regression and Random Forest). The models and the regression techniques used in them were applied to the mean hourly wind speeds and directions and air densities recorded in 2014 at ten weather stations in the Canary Archipelago (Spain). Several conclusions were drawn from the results, including most notably: (a) to clearly show the notable effect of air density variability when estimating WTPOs, it is important to consider the functional ways in which the features air density and wind speed and direction intervene, (b) of the five MCP models under comparison, the one that separately estimates wind speeds and air densities to later predict the WTPOs always provided the best mean absolute error, mean absolute relative error and coefficient of determination metrics, independently of the target station and type of WT under consideration, (c) the models which used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for regression or random forests (RFs) always provided better metrics than those that used artificial neural networks, with the differences being statistically significant (5% significance) for most of the cases assessed, (d) no statistically significant differences were found between the SVM- and RF-based models.},

Wind power forecasting tools enable better dispatch, scheduling and unit commitment of thermal generators, hydro plant and energy storage plant and more competitive market trading as wind power ramps up and down on the grid. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods and advances in wind power forecasting and prediction. Firstly, numerical wind prediction methods from global to local scales, ensemble forecasting, upscaling and downscaling processes are discussed. Next the statistical and machine learning approach methods are detailed.

In particular, we explore the use of the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) as a multi-output regression method. The resulting method we call Multi-Output Regression GANs (MOR-GANs) and its performance is compared to a Gaussian Process Regression method (GPR)—a commonly used non-parametric regression method that has been well tested on small datasets with noisy responses.

To validate these simulations, we gather metered time series from more than 1000 PV systems as well as national aggregate output reported by transmission network operators.

We correct for systematic bias by matching our simulations to the mean bias in modeling individual sites, then examine the long-term patterns, variability and correlation with power demand across Europe, using thirty years of simulated outputs. The results quantify how the increasing deployment of PV substantially changes net power demand and affects system adequacy and ramping requirements, with heterogeneous impacts across different European countries.

While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. MERRA-2 products are accessible online through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC).},

@article{era5,
   abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67% to 77%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},
