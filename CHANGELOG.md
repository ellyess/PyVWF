# Changelog

All notable changes to PyVWF are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
PyVWF adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the major version is 0, the public API may change in a minor release.

The version is defined once, in `vwf.__version__`; `pyproject.toml` reads it
from there and `tests/test_packaging.py` asserts `CITATION.cff` stays in step.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-14

Version 0.1.2 was bumped in the source but never tagged or released; its
changes are folded in here. This release is a minor rather than a patch bump
because it adds public API, removes packages from the core dependency set, and
changes the numbers the evaluation layer reports.

### Added

- **Correction-factor and evaluation diagnostics in `vwf.viz`.** Four figures
  promoted from the thesis plotting scripts, generalised (no hard-coded country
  or paths) and matplotlib-only:
  - `plot_correction_factor_map` — per-cluster Voronoi choropleth of the learned
    scalar and offset, on a diverging scale centred at the neutral value.
  - `plot_factor_joint` — the scalar-vs-offset joint distribution with marginal
    histograms.
  - `plot_error_vs_clusters` — error against cluster count, one line per temporal
    resolution, with the uncorrected error as a reference. The model-selection
    plot for choosing `n_clu` and `time_res`.
  - `plot_sim_vs_obs` — per-turbine mean simulated vs observed capacity factor
    against the `y = x` diagonal, annotated with fleet-level MBE and RMSE.
- `Results.train_turb_info`: the training fleet the correction factors were
  fitted on, which `plot_correction_factor_map` needs to reproduce cluster IDs.
- A `data` extra for the data-acquisition dependencies, and a `py.typed` marker
  so type information is exported to downstream users.
- Static type checking with mypy, and a `package` CI job that builds the sdist
  and wheel, validates the distribution metadata, and imports the installed
  wheel from a clean environment.
- Tests for the scientific core: known-answer tests for the error metrics, and
  an end-to-end test that drives the real `PyVWF.train` / `simulate_cf` over a
  synthetic fleet with a planted bias.

### Changed

- **`entsoe-py`, `openpyxl` and `pyarrow` moved out of the core dependencies**
  into the new `data` extra. They are only needed to *fetch* input data; nothing
  in the simulation, correction, evaluation or plotting path imports them.
  Install with `pip install "pyvwf[data]"` if you use `vwf.datasets`.
- `vwf.viz` is now imported unconditionally by `vwf/__init__.py`. It was
  previously guarded by a `try`/`except ImportError` that rebound `Results` and
  the `plot_*` functions to `None`, which turned a missing dependency into a
  confusing `AttributeError` deep in user code. `HAS_VIZ` remains, and is always
  `True`.
- The version is now single-sourced from `vwf.__version__` rather than
  duplicated into `pyproject.toml`.
- CI installs the package from `pyproject.toml` instead of a hand-curated pip
  list, so the declared dependency metadata is actually exercised.

### Fixed

- **Silent year-relabelling in the evaluation layer.**
  `metrics.prepare_monthly_data(train=True)` discarded the training
  observations' real `(year, month)` index and overwrote it with a hard-coded
  `2015-01`–`2019-12` range. Any training window that was not exactly those 60
  months raised a `ValueError`; worse, a 60-month window starting in a different
  year was silently relabelled, merging every observation against the wrong
  year's simulation and reporting plausible but incorrect error metrics. The
  real calendar labels are now preserved. **Error metrics computed for training
  windows other than 2015–2019 were wrong and should be recomputed.**
- `metrics.calculate_error` and `metrics.prepare_monthly_data` no longer mutate
  the caller's DataFrames in place. They previously assigned ID and time columns
  onto the shared fleet table, which callers reuse across many evaluations.
- `bottleneck` is a real dependency (xarray's `.bfill()` requires it, and
  `prep_era5` uses it for the surface-roughness field) and is now installed in
  CI, where the end-to-end example had been failing.
- Dropped `infer_objects(copy=False)` in the turbine loaders: the keyword is
  deprecated under pandas 3's copy-on-write and is slated for removal in
  pandas 4.
- Corrected several implicit-`Optional` annotations and initialised the
  country-level attributes on `PyVWF` that previously sprang into existence only
  when the right loader was called.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Paper revisions ahead of the JOSS submission.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Initial public release: turbine- and country-level wind simulation from ERA5
  reanalysis, the per-cluster linear wind-speed bias correction
  (`w' = scalar * w + offset`) at configurable spatial and temporal resolution,
  evaluation metrics, the `pyvwf-train` console script, and the distributional
  diagnostics (`plot_cf_distribution`, `plot_qq`) in `vwf.viz`.
